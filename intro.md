# Intro to Power System and Electricity Market Models

Powered by [ROPES Lab](https://sites.rutgers.edu/ropes-lab/)

This collection is meant to be an introduction to and collection of standard model formulations for power systems. 
For now, it focuses on (linear) optimal power flow formulations to support techno-econoic power system analyses.
These materials have been created for the course ISE 487: *Energy System Modeling and Optimization* at Rutgers University. 

This is the *gurobipy* version of this material. A *Julia/JuMP* is comming soon. A *cvxpy* and a *AMPL* version is planned.
